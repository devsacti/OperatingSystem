# Server
(To ME) Server â‰ˆ personal computer I use

Generally, personal computer = (SW + HW) = (Window OS + HW) or (Mac OS + HW)

In this context, Server = (Linux + HW), SW(OS) of Sever that controls the HW of Server

Linux is representative example of Operating System with Unix that canbe father of commercial OS like Mac,Window

## Operating System of Server
(To ME) OS is base of Runtime that supports Applications like JAVA-APP to work.

(ex) Linux like centos, ubuntu, AWS Linux etc that has JRE to init JAVA-APP

it is related with "terminal" of Server that canbe Interface of Server

, drivers for certain peripheral HW like mouse, printer, monitor,...

and network, security and everything
