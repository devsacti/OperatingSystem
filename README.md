# Server
(TO ME) Server â‰ˆ public Computer

Generally,

Computer = (SW + HW), and Personal Computer = (Windows OS + HW) or (Mac OS + HW) or ...

Server = (Linux OS + HW) or ...

Server can be regarded as 'remote public computer' that many persons use at the same time.

Let's start at this point!

## SW of Server : Operating System
(TO ME) OS is base layer of Middleware,Runtime that supports Web-App works

Linux is a representative kind of Operating System.

centos, ubuntu, AWS Linux are example of Linux.

and Generally, AWS Linux EC2 is Iaas-oriented, but already are configured to have runtime like JRE to init JAVA-APP

#### Linux
(TO ME) son of Unix

 Unix is ancestor of Linux and it canbe father of commercial OS like Mac,Window

it is related with almost everything. CPU, RAM, network, security, drivers for certain peripheral HW like mouse, printer, monitor,... 

[Linux](./Linux)

## HW of Server
Briefly, HW of Server is much more tough component than HW of PC.

because it is like sum of thousands of desktops and notebooks.

I am not good enough to deal with this part right now.

So, I will go ahead after checking that the cloud server solves this part to some extent.

## Categories of Server 
* on-premise
* Cloud
* hybrid

(based on how the Server is presented)

####
On-premise,representative of physical server, is like assembling a desktops that i will use.

####
Cloud is renting desktop that i will use.

####
hybrid, confusion of both.

Both have their pros and cons. but i think cloud server's value is counted relatively recently.

In this time, i'd like to concentrate on Cloud.

#### Running Cloud Server
Oracle and AWS provides cloud server like EC2, RDS and the related for web service
